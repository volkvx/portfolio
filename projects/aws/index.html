          <h2>AWS - Service Catalog redesign</h2>
          <p class="doc-section">The goal for AWS Service Catalog team is to provide administrators at large enterprises with tools to manage AWS computing products and allow internal users that may not be familiar with AWS launch the assigned products. The product should be scalable, easy and work on any device, including mobile. Historically, AWS navigation a fairly complex even for developers. Service Catalog was a strategic product to simplify such complexity and win enterprises over to use AWS platform. </p>
          <p class="doc-section">

I joined the team as the lead (and only) designer to resolve certain stalemate efforts to simplify some interactions. Unlike many other projects where user research would lead to generating UX insights, this project required a different approach. It required rethinking the architecture, dependencies, storage and creation of new design patterns.
</p>


  <blockquote class="default">
    <p class="large-quote">Vadim brings amazingly clear thinking to seemingly complex situations. His ability to look at an interface and simplify it is unbelievable. He thinks deeply and thoroughly and can create or discover solutions to any problem. 
    </p>
  </blockquote>


<p class="doc-section">

I was involved in the project for little over a year and within that time completely transformed the product. I also established the UX discipline within the team to focus on the user needs first from establishing how customer insights are gathered to changing the architecture and the designs of the Service Catalog focusing on the user needs. The effort involved a large number of cross-team integration points: AWS’ tagging service, AWS Marketplace, legal teams, solution architects, etc. Countless sketches, over 2000 mockups and a dozen interactive prototypes paved the way to a more usable product. The team also took an audacious step to separate from the existing internal Amazon design frameworks and follow Google’s Material Design guidelines, for application to support mobile platforms. We also committed to making the application brandable for companies to customize the look as well as release the framework as open source. The lack of solid frameworks to implement a Progressive Web App (PWA) and the desire to make it an open source meant we had to write the entire framework in house. Essentially, we came to a point to start with a blank sheet.

Changing the architecture meant starting the development effort from the beginning and there was much more scrutiny for the new designs and I had to make sure it operates well within the existing AWS tagging architecture. </p>

The common error cases would be user exceeding some input, or deleting a non-empty portfolio would generate an error. Most of these cases do not require showing an error, in fact, we didn't want to show any errors. Exceeding the string limit could simply be solved by preventing a user from entering a longer string, or instead of showing an error for deleting a non-empty portfolio we could delete the items inside making it intuitive and forgiving (as providing an undo). Turned out the experience can be made much more intuitive by preemptively solving errors. </p>

Imagine a user inserting a row in a table. A notification could show a text stating "A new row was inserted". But processing that notification requires extensive comprehension and it doesn't link the message to a potential question "where the new row was inserted?" A better approach is to show the effect of the user action directly in the UI. As inserting a row could hightlight a new row in a table with potential controls to undo the action. This would avoid confirmations and instantly provides a feedback about the user action. </p>

Generally cards can be more more flexible for showing inormation that may vary from card to card (as showing error state within a card). Here are some list designs that we tried.</p>

		<p class="doc-section">While the small may seem insignificant, a good design makes sure that details are not overlooked. Here's an example where I noticed that the legal copyright string was too long for mobile and wasn't communicating the proper message. Generally, showing a copyright string is a good way to indicathe the end of the page so it does serve a purpose besides simply displaying a copyright information. In this case I researched the need to display a range of years and the need to show "All rights reserved". Turned out, those parts are superflous. I got in touch with our legal team and was able to change the copyringht notice to be a tad more user friendly. It also fit nicely on mobile.</p>

Since I was working on AWS Service Catalog (an internal catalog of software) users could greatly benefit from a way to simply copy products from AWS Marketplace into the internally managed catalog of products. I designed several integration strategies starting from the basic initial release where users could copy the products to a full integration where administrators would be notified of the new versions and having a complete managed lifecycle.</p>

		<h3 class="section-heading">Changing product container</h3>
			<p class="doc-section">As many of the architectural pieces were coming along, there was one sticking point remained preventing a fairly straightforward UX from being developed. It had to do with products and product versions. In the existing architecture, the product was a virtual container that had multiple product versions stored inside of it. When a user launches a product, a specific version within that product would need to be picked to run. That means while the user thinks about launching a "product" the actual "version" would run. It may sound logical, but in reality odd things were happening. There could be two different product containers each having identical versions – this would be confusing to have different names for the same product. Also when a product needs updating, a new version would be copied inside a product container. But which product container needs updating? This would be ambiguous. A better architectural approach needed to be developed. At this point I had a good understanding of the user scenarios and was able to design a better architecture. In essence, instead of having a product container, only versions would be stored internally. To the user, similar versions (all versions still have a “product name”) would be grouped together and can be managed as one entity. So most previous scenarios would still work as before: removing a “product” would translate to removing all similar versions. But in the new architecture, there would be no case of duplicated products or ambiguity about which version to update. </p>

		<h3 class="section-heading">Architecting custom actions</h3>
			<p class="doc-section">It is impossible to predict what type of actions a product may need to handle. Since here we deal with enterprise clients and AWS products, all “products” are virtualized computing instances. All products would need to support an action to Launch and Terminate and maybe Update. But besides these three actions, the support for other actions may be product specific. Within large enterprises, admins may want to define what those other custom actions might be, what products they may apply to and who can or cannot execute them. But what would the architecture be to support such flexibility? I designed the architecture to support such actions. Essentially an admin would create a global action, say “backup” for backing up databases and specify a namespace to indicate the type of computing it applies to. Since almost all computing instances are running within EC2 types, the custom action could be “EC2: Backup”. At this point we don’t know which instances are databases and which are not. There would be concepts of a white and a black lists that would make that such a link. In the backup case, an admin would be able to whitelist “INVOICES” instances and all the invoices databases would now have a custom action backup that can be executed. Alternatively, a user choosing a Backup action would be able to run a backup command on all Invoice instances. </p>

			<p class="doc-section">One of the challenges with AWS in general is the complexity of creating a solution. There are many multi-step tutorials that exist for creating solutions, but it is a challenge to create a multi-resource environment and have an ease of tearing it down when needed. Service Catalog offers a native ability to define solutions by linking multiple products and launching them as a single solution. It would be helpful for administrators to offer common sandbox environments where enterprise-class solutions can be tested. Here’s one of the designs that allows users setting up “best practice solutions” within Service Catalog. While it may look simple, the concept of providing such enterprise-grade solutions is unique.  </p>

The Service Catalog product that my team was building went through significant changes and those need to be documented in the public help content. As part of driving a change, I created many architectural diagrams and UX prototypes to sell the new vision to the team. Those diagrams became the official help content for AWS.</p>

Due to complexity and the primary focus on the largest enterprises, there were challenges to recruit participants that would have understanding of the needs of large enterprises. We established an ongoing dialog with some key companies through and called it Customer Advisory Board. Through such discussions, we could get a better understanding of the user needs and get feedback on our solutions. I also partnered with AWS research team to develop personas and make sure we are delivering a consistent message across the entire AWS.</p>

		<h3 class="section-heading">The end and the new beginning</h3>
		<p class="doc-section">I joined AWS Service Catalog team with a simple mission to design a screens to make the enterprise AWS product more usable.  The product was in a beta state and without usability improvements specifically targeting large enterprises, AWS faced missing out on many large contracts. There was no prior UX involvement on the team, and the project seemed to be a short one. What ended up happening is focusing on the user needs completely changed the nature of the product and the nature of the development. I not only created the mockups, but redesigned large architectural parts of the product. That meant taking a step back and rewrite large portions of the product. I was able to drive consensus on the team and change the foundation of the product. The design was a fairly large undertaking as well: completely new patterns had to be developed, the ubiquitous table-based AWS paradigms had to be changed to something else as they didn’t work well on mobile. For overall development a new framework had to be designed and we based on Google’s Material Design. Also the application had goals to be brandable so that enterprises could match their own brand colors. We also wanted to allow offline operations so we picked to develop a Progressive Web App (PWA). This was the first effort at Amazon that I know to depart from many internal design frameworks and adopt Google’s Material Design principles. The goal was also to develop a flexible framework that can be open-sourced, so a lot of effort was spent on understanding the licensing of every design element so that we could release an open source version in the future.  There were many smaller design project along the way involving cross-team integration with other AWS teams that touch enterprise management and with AWS Marketplace. It was a year full of accomplishments and delighted customers that were showcasing my team’s designs as great examples of intuitive applications. 
</p>
<p class="doc-section">
The new architecture, designs, and the established focus on the user demonstrated that having UX involvement earlier would likely to save time and not require significant rewrites. Having a successful product that was unlike anything previously released by AWS was a blessing and a curse. Customer were happy but the with the change of management the vision had lost some key allies and a question became “why does it feel like it is coming from our competitor Google?” While the look of the product was specific to AWS, the feel adhered to principles of Google’s Material Design framework. At the same time a new initiative within AWS was underway to unify all internal AWS applications under a new design framework Polaris. One thing certain about Amazon is that things never stay still and will change. While the designed foundation will likely remain in the foreseeable future, the look of Service Catalog will likely change. And a new cycle of iterative design starts, but this time it is grounded on a solid foundation and the focus on the end user will remain…
